Great question — and the answer is:

> ❌ **No**, a class in a **child (sub) package** cannot access a **package-private** class in its **parent package** — even if both are in the same project or module.

---

## 🧠 Why?

In Java, **package-private access** (i.e., **no modifier**) means:

* The class or member is accessible **only within the same package**.
* **Sub-packages are not included** in the "same package".

---

## 📦 Example

### `com/example/ClassA.java`

```java
package com.example;

class ClassA {
    void hello() {
        System.out.println("Hello from ClassA");
    }
}
```

### `com/example/sub/ClassB.java`

```java
package com.example.sub;

import com.example.ClassA;

public class ClassB {
    public void test() {
        ClassA a = new ClassA();  // ❌ ERROR: ClassA is not visible
        a.hello();                // ❌
    }
}
```

---

## 🚫 Compile-Time Error

You’ll get:

```
ClassA is not public in com.example; cannot be accessed from outside package
```

## 📌 Important Clarification

| Situation                               | Can Access Package-Private? |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Same package                            | ✅ Yes                       |
| Sub-package (e.g., `com.example.sub`)   | ❌ No                        |
| Parent package (e.g., `com.example`)    | ❌ No                        |
| Same package name across different JARs | ❌ No                        |

---

## ✅ Solution

If you want `com.example.sub` to access `ClassA`, then you must make `ClassA`:

```java
public class ClassA { ... }
```

> Also remember: if it's `public`, the **.java file name must match the class name**.
